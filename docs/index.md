## Why Ripple Router?

Ripple Router aims to be the simplest router you can use in a Ripple app while still
providing enough features for common apps: nested routes, dynamic parameters, link
components, and programmatic navigation. It's intentionally small so it can be
composed with other libraries and integrated into existing projects easily.
